## Skills

#### Innovative Collaborator
Having an innovative mindset and inventive thinking results in improved performance which I can highlight from my experience in my role at urbanest. I had the ability to think on my feet and handle customer service requests and complaints from start to finish, handling a mixture of issues and using my skills to resolve conflicts.

Working on group projects such as [Acebook](https://github.com/florence-bain/acebook-runtime-terror) and [Traderunner](https://github.com/florence-bain/CRYP-3PO) illustrate team working capabilities following an agile product development process and developer workflows. Daily standups and retros identified areas that needed improving for example during the [Traderunner](https://github.com/florence-bain/CRYP-3PO) project, the team was not aligned with the priority of tasks, to solve this solution I recommended we start using a card wall and pair programming to keep on track.
                  
#### Self-Starter
An everlasting hunger for new challenges and projects to continue learning new material and concepts effectively and efficiently.
With eagerness to familiarize myself with Python for the [Traderunner](https://github.com/florence-bain/CRYP-3PO) project, using Python for the first time I took it upon myself to start delving into python and coincidentally I found an intrest in learning about how blockchains work. This is a work in progress, however I really enjoyed getting the exposure and found it to be so intriguing to understand how the blockchain works. [my-project](https://github.com/florence-bain/my-project) example.

Each morning personal learning objectives for the day are recorded, working towards higher-level learning goals. At the end of each day, a daily review to reflect on the objectives I set out to achieve is completed. This approach adds structure and motivation in a fast-paced environment and enables me to manage my own well being.

Achieved managing 2020's re-booking students within urbanest, coordinating with mulitiple departments and moved 100 students across sites within London during a two week period with no complications which reflects my ambitious attitude and a keen eye for detail, transferring these skills to software development.
                  
#### Communication
Having worked in customer serivce for almost a decade and as a customer service assistant for urbanest for the last two and a half years,  communication has been vital internally and externally. Created professional correspondence in email form, telephony, and mail on a daily basis. Led workshops to train new colleagues and attend meeting with the local community, give presentations regarding new innovative ideas and efficient workflows. At Makers I pair programmed daily and often have the chance to be the scrum leader for our group projects. I am flexible and able to modify my process to align with the team. 
                  
#### Self-Confidence
My self-confidence and personal development have benefitted from not only securing a place Makers but also four years traveling and working in Europe, Asia, New Zealand, and Australia. Subjecting myself to a diverse range of employers and environments has significantly improved my ability to overcome obstacles that come with entering into the unknown, to be able to think practically and adapt to difficult situations.
During [MakersBnb](https://github.com/florence-bain/MakersBnb) my self confidence took a hit as I felt like I was not up to the same level as my peers, however as the week went on my confidence grew and I started to ask more questions ensuring I understood what we were doing and why. This was a great experience for growth and allowed me to embrace the feeling of uncertainty and take my learning into my own hands.
                  
#### Commitment
Following many months of research and practice, I was incredibly committed to secure a place on the Makers bootcamp and more determined after having not been sucessful in getting a place for the scholarship. I was able to make use of my desire to learn, with curiosity pushing me to use self-led learning techniques to prepare for the application process and have the commitment to work every day to ensure there was a possibility of being accepted. With discipline, focus, and motivation I have been able to progress with my journey of becoming a software developer.
As a compassionate person, I am continuously striving to support others and committed to making positive changes.
